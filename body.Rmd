# Introduction

`bookdown+`? Hmm...sounds like something related to the R[@R-base] package `bookdown` [@R-bookdown]? 

Yes, you **_R_** right. Everyone knows that `bookdown` is an excellent package for authoring books on programming languages. But it is only one side of the coin.  It can do more than expected. `bookdown` smells like a tasty cake. I have been expecting someone to cut it. Now I am helping myself. Therefore I am developing `bookdown+`.

\m{It IS tasty!}

This book which you are reading was exactly produced by `bookdown+`.

`bookdown+` is an extension of `bookdown`. It is a collection of multiple templates, which I collected years ago on the basis of \LaTeX, and have been tailoring them so that I can work happily under the umbrella of `bookdown`. `bookdown+` shows you the other side of the coin, which helps you write academic journal articles, guitar books, chemical equations, mails, calendars, and diaries.

I believe some official bookdown templates will be available in the near future, but I cannot wait. Can you?

With `bookdown+` you can

- record guitar chords,

- write a mail in an elegant layout,

- write a laboratory journal, or a personal diary,

- draw a monthly or weekly or conference calendar,

- and, of course, write academic articles in your favourite way,

- with chemical molecular formulae and equations,

- even in Chinese,

- and more wonders will come soon.

`bookdown+` is developed on the basis of the following outstanding work:

- R bookdown package [@R-bookdown]

- Two minimal book examples using bookdown by Yihui Xie ^[https://github.com/yihui/bookdown-minimal] ^[https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo]

- gchords, a LaTeX package for typesetting guitar chord diagrams by Kasper Peeters ^[http://kasper.phi-sci.com/gchords/]

- Copernicus Publications LaTeX Package ^[http://publications.copernicus.org/for_authors/latex_instructions.html]

# Quick Start

## Preparation

Before starting, you have to install R, RStudio, bookdown package, and other software and packages (i.e. `Pandoc`, \LaTeX, `rmarkdown`, `rticle`, `knitr`, etc.) which bookdown depends on. See the official manual of bookdown ^[https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/] for details.

If you are ready, [download `bookdown+`](https://github.com/dapengde/bookdown-plus/archive/master.zip) package as a zip file from Github. Unzip it to a folder in your PC. You will find a file named `_start.Rproj`. Double click it, and it will be opened by RStudio.

OK, now you can see a `_runme.R` file as well. Open it and run the script, or follow my explanation as follows,

## Step 1. Title and author

Specify the title and the author of your book, article, guitar book, or whatever.

## Step 2: Template

Choose a template out of the available templates. Here I choose the 8th.


Run `fun/build.R`.

## Step 3: Write and Build

Now you can press `ctrl+shift+b` to build a demo book, which you can find in `book/`.

Write your own text in `body.Rmd`, and build your own lovely book. 

Have fun!

# Showcase 

Hereby the key elements in a book are displayed so as to show the readers how your book produced by bookdown+ will look like.
